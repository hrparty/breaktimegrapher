# Breaktimegrapher

My friend [Ragnar Freyr](http://ragnarfreyr.com/about/) wanted to write down the number of pomodoros
he did per day, which he tracked with the [Breaktime app](http://breaktimeapp.com/).

So I helped him out by creating a ruby script that graphs out the number of pomodoros in a simple text file, formatted like this:

```
01.01.2015: xx
02.01.2015: xxxx
03.01.2015: xxx
04.01.2015: xxxxx
etc.
```

Created this script in ruby and then called it from an applescript, because the Breaktime app enables applescripts to be run,
but I didn't want to learn applescript at that time. Chose ruby because it is installed by default on macs.
